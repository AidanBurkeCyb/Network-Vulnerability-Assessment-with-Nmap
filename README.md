# Network-Vulnerability-Assessment-with-Nmap

this project will be particularly useful for anyone who is using an M chip macbook, and using UTM as a VM.

## Project Description
This project aims to demonstrate the use of Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool, to identify vulnerabilities within a controlled environment using Metasploitable, a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine on UTM with a Mac running an M1 pro chip. Through various Nmap scanning techniques, this project will uncover live hosts, open ports, and the services running on those hosts, ultimately assessing the security posture of the network. The findings will be documented and presented in a comprehensive report, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities and recommendations for remediation. This project serves as a practical example for those interested in network security and vulnerability assessment.

## Objectives
- Identify live hosts on the network.
- Discover open ports and services running on those hosts.
- Assess vulnerabilities using Nmap scripts.

- ## Tools Used
- **M1 MacBook:** The host machine used for the project.
- **UTM:** Virtual machine software to run Metasploitable.
- **Homebrew:** Package manager for installing Nmap and other tools.
- **QEMU:** Used for converting the Metasploitable VMDK file to QCOW format.
- **Metasploitable:** Deliberately vulnerable virtual machine for testing.
- **Nmap:** Network scanning tool for vulnerability assessment.

## Prerequisites
- **Metasploitable VM:** [Instructions for converting the VMDK to a QCOW file and setting it up in UTM.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3IJ_d3rAgA&t=224s)
- **Nmap:** Instructions for installing Nmap on your host machine.

# Tools to Install
Before starting this project, run the following commands to install all the necessary tools:


```bash
Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Install QEMU
```bash
brew install qemu
```
## Install UTM
```bash
brew install --cask utm
```
## Install Nmap
```bash
brew install nmap
```
# Download Metasploitable
https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/

# Steps

- **1** \- I ran a ping scan in terminal
  ```bash
  nmap -sn <ip address>
  ```

- **2** \- I identified the Metasploitable (vulnerable machines IP address)
  Open metasploitable in UTM VM. It's a CLI OS so it will default to that. Run the following command
  ```bash
  ifconfig
  ```
  Look for the IP address under the eth0 interface

- **3** \- Run a ping scan on your local network and identify live hosts:
  ```bash
  nmap -sn <192.xxx.x.x/x>
  ```
