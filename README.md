# Network-Vulnerability-Assessment-with-Nmap

this project will be particularly useful for anyone who is using an M chip macbook, and using UTM as a VM.

## Project Description
This project aims to demonstrate the use of Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool, to identify vulnerabilities within a controlled environment using Metasploitable, a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine on UTM with a Mac running an M1 pro chip. Through various Nmap scanning techniques, this project will uncover live hosts, open ports, and the services running on those hosts, ultimately assessing the security posture of the network. The findings will be documented and presented in a comprehensive report, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities and recommendations for remediation. This project serves as a practical example for those interested in network security and vulnerability assessment.

## Objectives
- Identify live hosts on the network.
- Discover open ports and services running on those hosts.
- Assess vulnerabilities using Nmap scripts.

- ## Tools Used
- **M1 MacBook:** The host machine used for the project.
- **UTM:** Virtual machine software to run Metasploitable.
- **Homebrew:** Package manager for installing Nmap and other tools.
- **QEMU:** Used for converting the Metasploitable VMDK file to QCOW format.
- **Metasploitable:** Deliberately vulnerable virtual machine for testing.
- **Nmap:** Network scanning tool for vulnerability assessment.

## Prerequisites
- **Metasploitable VM:** [Instructions for converting the VMDK to a QCOW file and setting it up in UTM.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3IJ_d3rAgA&t=224s)
- **Nmap:** Instructions for installing Nmap on your host machine.

# Tools to Install
Before starting this project, run the following commands to install all the necessary tools:

  ## Homebew
  ```bash
  Install Homebrew
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```

  ## Install QEMU
  ```bash
  brew install qemu
  ```
  ## Install UTM
  ```bash
  brew install --cask utm
  ```
  ## Install Nmap
  ```bash
  brew install nmap
  ```
  # Download Metasploitable
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/

# Steps

- **1** \- I ran a ping scan in terminal
  ```bash
  nmap -sn <ip address>
  ```

- **2** \- I identified the Metasploitable virtual machines IP address by running the following command
  ```bash
  ifconfig
  ```
  Look for and take note of the IP address under the eth0 interface

- **3** \- I performed a vulnerability scan on all live hosts using Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
  ```bash
  nmap -Pn --script=vuln <192.xxx.x.x/x>
  ```
- **4** \- Retrieve the results in text format
  Upon reviewing I can see that all IPs past a certain numerical value don't return anything. So I will export the ones that did return a value to a text file.
  ```bash
  nmap -Pn --script=vuln <192.xxx.xxx.0-3> -oN vulnerability_scan_results.txt
  ```
- **5** \- Analyse the Vulnerabilities found documenting a list of all identified vulnerabilities,
- Overview of vulnerabilities from the scan
  Detailed vulnerability findings

# Conclusion
  Summarise the key takeaways from the vulnerability analysis. Highlight the most critical vulnerabilities that need immediate attention.

# Recommendations
  	•	Provide actionable recommendations to mitigate the vulnerabilities found. This could include:
	•	Updating or patching vulnerable software.
	•	Configuring services securely.
	•	Implementing network security measures like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
